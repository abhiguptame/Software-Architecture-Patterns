# Software Architecture Patterns:

## Patterns in Software:
- Solution to common problem 
- Components and interactions

## Design Pattern vs Architecture Patterns:

| Design Pattern | Architecture Patterns |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| Small amount of components | Defines a significant part of the application |
| Part of a larger application | Many components and mostly paradigm independent |

## Categories of patterns:
1. Application Landscape
2. Application Structure 
3. User Interface

## 1. Application Landscape Pattern:
- Single application to the end user
- Multiple applications behind the scenes possible

### Application Landscape Pattern Types:
- Monolith
- N-tier
- Service-oriented
- Microservices
- Serverless
- Peer-to-peer

#### Monolith:
- Single Executable 

#### Monolith: Advantages
- Easy to understand, implement, and test
- Easy deployment
- Ideal for limited scope

#### Monolith: Disadvantages
- Tight coupling
- Easily leads to complex code
- One size fits all for every subdomain

## 2. Application Structure Patterns:
- Single executable
- Can be part of a larger application landscape

### Application Structure Pattern Types:
- Layered
- Microkernel
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- Event sourcing
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation and Event sourcing combined

## 3. User Interface Patterns:
- Model-view-controller (MVC)
- Model-view-presenter (MVP)
- Model-view-viewmodel (MVVM)
